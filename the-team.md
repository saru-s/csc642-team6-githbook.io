This is my last semester at San Francisco State University.  It's funny knowing I finished all my classes using a 2010 HDD dual core laptop the whole way through.

## Leo Saeturn

Hello! My name is Leo Saeteurn. I am a senior at San Francisco State University and will be graduating in fall with just two classes left. This has been a long journey for me from transferring from a junior college to just a few years at SF State. Can't wait to complete these courses and receive my BS in CS!
