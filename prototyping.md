### UI Changes:

1: Initially we had main menu with bottons on topside with no icons which felt cluttered for a homepage and wasn't descriptive enough to show what each interactive button was supposed to do.

Improvement: We changed this to include an image icon alongside an image used as a descriptor or symbol for what the webpage was about.  We moved the buttons from topside to bottom side, and added a Logo.

</div>

2: There was interactive components missing prior to going into HighFidelity.

Improvement: We added a functional Facade that let users see how the webpage was navigated, for our Tranlate webpage, we added interaction where onclick on language gave english and Spanish, clicking in the box under language put in Hello in english, where submit reveals the Spanish translation result.
