# Pitch

Conversing with others is an essential component to life. It's how we are able to go about our day to day lives. The world is grand, and the diverse cultures that nurture earth are rich. It's just been within recent years in which people have been able to communicate with others globally. This is in part thanks to technology and the rise of translation applications; however, most translation apps fail to provide "in-context" translations to their users. This is why we introduce to you, "Translator." Our product puts emphasis on closing the gap between languages and makes translations for all languages possible. By offering a website with features such as direct text translation, image recognition translation, document translation, and on-demand speech to text translations, we aim to connect the world together with our technology, reducing the displacement of language recognition for lesser used languages as well as provided a more refined "in-context" language translation for all of our users. We have identified problems that we believe people face almost everyday in different places, we've researched and recognized the problem first hand by surveying those who have faced these issues and hearing from them, we've analyzed the responses thoroughly so that we can come up with the best solutions to best fit our users, or in fact anyone, needs, and we designed what we believe the next evolution of a translation application. We understand that what we have researched so far is likely not as far deep as we'd like to go given the timeframe that we had, but in future plans, we'd like to continue the project and improvement of it. This is our Translator.
