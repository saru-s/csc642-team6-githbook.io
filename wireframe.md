# Wireframe

Our initial wireframe is a low-level prototype of our website that we originally designed. We laid this out to get a good sense of how we want our website to look like and what features we'd like to add for users after identifying some of the situations and issues they faced. We came up with some solutions that we thought best fit the needs of our users because we recognized a lot of the obstacles when it comes to having language barrier no matter where the occasion may happen and basically drew it out in the form of a digital wireframe.\
\
We used Figma to put our wireframe together. We added multiple pages that represented a landing page (Main page), the login page - where users can login into an account to manage their personal data, a sign up page - where users can create a free account to personalize their data, a main page for the users that are logged in, and a user account page - where users can save their data. In addition, there are pages for the key features:&#x20;

* Text translation page - users can input a text, select a language of that text, then select a language of their preference to translate to, and a display where the text is translated in their preferred language.
* Image translation page - users can upload an image, select a language they'd like to know the word in, and a display of the word in their preferred language of what the image is.
* Document translation page - users can upload a document, select the language that the document is written in, select a language to be translated in, and a display where all the texts within the original document will be translated in the preferred language.
* Pronunciation page - users can input a word, select a language of that word, select a language they'd like to translate in, and an audio where it pronounces the word in their preferred language.

As we continue the progress of our design and prototype, we will improve and identify better user interface and features to be added and/or modified for our final product.
