## Data Collection

Our research aimed to find out and address the issue of language barriers that people face in various situations. To achieve this goal, we decided to conduct open-ended surveys where we get some volunteers to answer some questions that we have. The surveys were anonymous. The primary participants for the research were students attending San Francisco State University who speak two or more languages. The participants were reached out through the chatting platform, Discord servers as it is one of the popular online platforms among students. The participants were encouraged to share their personal experiences and perspectives on language barriers.  The open-ended survey questions provided a medium for participants to share in detail which further aided us in understanding obstacles they were facing because of language barrier.&#x20;

Our survey questions were:

Are you a student attending SFSU?

Do you or a family member speak a second language?

Can you share a moment when you felt that there was language barrier in recent times?

Can you describe your most memorable experience you've had when you felt difficulty connecting with others with language?

What are the typical strategies that you follow when you perceive that there is a language barrier?

Where do you feel language barriers most commonly occur?

What d oyou think would help you in navigating the language barrier on a day-to-day basis?

Have you ever used a translation tool? If so, how was your experience using the tool? What could be improved upon?

Is there anything else you'd like to share about the problems you face?



## Data Analysis

we were able to get ten volunteers to take our survey.  After looking through the responses, we used the Affinity Diagram method to analyze the data that we collected and identified common themes and subgroups within our data. We started by grouping the responses together based on the questions, then we found common responses across the questions so we grouped them together to create some themes that we found that popped up a lot. We sectioned each theme and decided to dig deeper. We noticed that the responses within these themes were all related but some were very similar to each other so we created subgroups within the themes. Through our research, we found that language barriers exist in many forms of communication, including low language proficiency and other factors such as accents. We also discovered that existing tools, such as Google Translate, are not always effective in connecting communication gaps. The research was conducted to explore language barriers and their impact on communication in different contexts.
