# Research

## Data Collection

Our research aimed to find out and address the issue of language barriers that people face in various situations. To achieve this goal, we decided to conduct open-ended surveys where we get some volunteers to answer some questions that we have. The surveys were anonymous. The primary participants for the research were students attending San Francisco State University who speak two or more languages. The participants were reached out through the chatting platform, Discord servers as it is one of the popular online platforms among students. The participants were encouraged to share their personal experiences and perspectives on language barriers.  The open-ended survey questions provided a medium for participants to share in detail which further aided us in understanding obstacles they were facing because of language barrier.&#x20;

Our survey questions were:

1. Are you a student attending SFSU?
2. Do you or a family member speak a second language?
3. Can you share a moment when you felt that there was language barrier in recent times?
4. Can you describe your most memorable experience you've had when you felt difficulty connecting with others with language?
5. What are the typical strategies that you follow when you perceive that there is a language barrier?
6. Where do you feel language barriers most commonly occur?
7. What do you think would help you in navigating the language barrier on a day-to-day basis?
8. Have you ever used a translation tool? If so, how was your experience using the tool? What could be improved upon?
9. Is there anything else you'd like to share about the problems you face?

## Data Analysis

There were 10 voluntary participants who completed our survey. In this project, we chose Affinity Diagram to analyze our collected data.&#x20;

First, all data were collected and common themes among data were identified.                            &#x20;

Then, after observing common themes, we sectioned each theme and dug deeper. We noticed that the responses within these themes were all related but some were very similar to each other so we created subgroups within the themes.&#x20;

## Findings

From our data collection we were able to come to certain conclusions involving when and where language barriers are formed. Language barriers were mainly found when interacting with others whether that be in a school setting, at home, and even outside stores especially when traveling. The most pressing issues are finding the correct way to interact/speak with others in the sense where talking or being talked to can sometimes become difficult. This difficult situation could be due to different cultures where people say or do things differently especially when it comes to dialects/accents. Another reason these situations can occur can stem from different spoken languages or circumstances where the spoken language isn’t fluent enough to understand everything that’s being conveyed to them. In these cases it can be daunting to reach out for help from others, in which case, they fall into a more complacent mindset. This mindset, where people know there’s an issue but don’t bring it upon themselves to act upon, causes people to get used to thinking that this is the social normality. We also have the situation where people zone-out or become disconnected from the conveyor whether that be spoken or written down.

There is also the opposite case where people are attentive and actively seek reaffirmation with others by asking questions, learning about different languages, and even trying to work things out with body language and translation resources. Google being one of the main resources that aid others in resolving these issues. Some of these resources include Google Images and Google Translate which both integrate well with each other when attempting to bridge a language barrier in terms of linguistics. Where this starts to fall short in terms of solving the language barrier is when the database doesn’t translate correctly or even when the database doesn’t have a language in their system. This can be easily seen when you try to translate from one language to another language and back to the original; the output won’t give you the same result that was originally put in, kind of like the game telephone, but in this case, it’s passing translated words around.

## Design Scope Based on Findings

After analyzing the data collected from the survey, we felt that there is a need for an improved technological platform to help people with language barriers. Therefore, we planned to move forward with researching the ideas that would assist users and help fulfill their demand in their daily language barrier situation. The directions that we took into consideration after our data analysis are translation platforms. After studying responses from participants, we found that the availability of resources like a translator in different forms stood out to be a popular solution for language barrier. Therefore, we decided to explore this solution as our potential product design.&#x20;

One design could be a translator extension that could be incorporated in different digital platforms like web browsers like Google Chrome, and software applications, like Zoom. The primary function of this extension would be to provide options for users that can translate to their preferred language. For example, English to Spanish, Spanish to Chinese, and so on. However, it is important to note that there are huge numbers of languages spoken world-wide, and it would be an intensive task to encompass all languages in the design right away. Therefore, the design would start from some dominant languages, then subsequently include as many languages as possible.&#x20;

Another design idea is a translator with the additional feature of semantic analysis of words after translation. This design builds upon previously mentioned design. Since, participants expressed that accents/dialects could also hinder learning different languages, we thought it would be a good idea to have features that would offer meanings and definitions of translated words, and pronunciations of the word in both languages involved in the translation process.&#x20;

Next design idea is also a feature that could be added on to the main design. This feature would display a user’s input of words that are transformed into different languages without having to prompt a user for the specific language. In this manner, users can take a look at the word in different languages at a glance, and choose the preferred language.
